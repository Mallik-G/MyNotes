## **Big Data Basics**

#### **What is Big Data?**

Big Data is a term used for collections of datasets that are large and complex, which are difficult to store and process using available database management tools or traditional data processing applications. 

The challenge includes capturing, curating, storing, searching, sharing, transferring, analyzing and visualization of these datasets.

#### **Big Data Characteristics**

The five characteristics that define Big Data are: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity and Value.

1. ##### VOLUME

   Volume refers to the ‘amount of data’, which is growing day by day at a very fast pace. The size of data generated by humans, machines and their interactions on social media itself is massive. Researchers have predicted that 40 Zettabytes (40,000 Exabytes) will be generated by 2020, which is an increase of 300 times from 2005.

2. ##### **VELOCITY**

   Velocity is defined as the pace at which different sources generate the data every day. This flow of data is massive and continuous. There are 1.03 billion Daily Active Users (Facebook DAU) on Mobile as of now, which is an increase of 22% year-over-year. This shows how fast the number of users are growing on social media and how fast the data is getting generated daily. If you are able to handle the velocity, you will be able to generate insights and take decisions based on real-time data.

3. ##### **VARIETY**

   As there are many sources which are contributing to Big Data, the type of data they are generating is different. It can be structured, semi-structured or unstructured. Hence, there is a variety of data which is getting generated every day. Earlier, we used to get the data from excel and databases, now the data are coming in the form of images, audios, videos, sensor data etc. as shown in below image. Hence, this variety of unstructured data creates problems in capturing, storage, mining and analyzing the data.

4. ##### **VERACITY**

   Veracity refers to the data in doubt or uncertainty of data available due to data inconsistency and incompleteness. In the image below, you can see that few values are missing in the table. Also, a few values are hard to accept, for example – 15000 minimum value in the 3rd row, it is not possible. This inconsistency and incompleteness is Veracity.

   Data available can sometimes get messy and maybe difficult to trust. With many forms of big data, quality and accuracy are difficult to control like Twitter posts with hashtags, abbreviations, typos and colloquial speech. The volume is often the reason behind for the lack of quality and accuracy in the data. 

   - Due to uncertainty of data, 1 in 3 business leaders don’t trust the information they use to make decisions.
   - It was found in a survey that 27% of respondents were unsure of how much of their data was inaccurate.
   - Poor data quality costs the US economy around $3.1 trillion a year.

5. ##### **VALUE**

   After discussing Volume, Velocity, Variety and Veracity, there is another V that should be taken into account when looking at Big Data i.e. Value. It is all well and good to have access to big data but unless we can turn it into value it is useless. By turning it into value I mean, Is it adding to the benefits of the organizations who are analyzing big data? Is the organization working on Big Data achieving high ROI (Return On Investment)? Unless, it adds to their profits by working on Big Data, it is useless.

#### **Types of Big Data**

Big Data could be of three types:

- Structured
- Semi-Structured
- Unstructured

1. ##### **Structured**

   The data that can be stored and processed in a fixed format is called as Structured Data. Data stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS) is one example of  ‘structured’ data. It is easy to process structured data as it has a fixed schema. Structured Query Language (SQL) is often used to manage such kind of Data.

2. ##### **Semi-Structured**

   Semi-Structured Data is a type of data which does not have a formal structure of a data model, i.e. a table definition in a relational DBMS, but nevertheless it has some organizational properties like tags and other markers to separate semantic elements that makes it easier to analyze. XML files or JSON documents are examples of semi-structured data.

3. ##### **Unstructured**

   The data which have unknown form and cannot be stored in RDBMS and cannot be analyzed unless it is transformed into a structured format is called as unstructured data. Text Files and multimedia contents like images, audios, videos are example of unstructured data. The unstructured data is growing quicker than others, experts say that 80 percent of the data in an organization are unstructured.

## **Examples of Big Data**

Daily we upload millions of bytes of data. 90 % of the world’s data has been created in last two years.

- Walmart handles more than **1 million** customer transactions every hour.
- Facebook stores, accesses, and analyzes **30+ Petabytes** of user generated data.
- **230+ millions** of tweets are created every day.
- More than **5 billion** people are calling, texting, tweeting and browsing on mobile phones worldwide.
- YouTube users upload **48 hours** of new video every minute of the day.
- Amazon handles **15 million** customer click stream user data per day to recommend products.
- **294 billion** emails are sent every day. Services analyses this data to find the spams.
- Modern cars have close to **100 sensors** which monitors fuel level, tire pressure etc. , each vehicle generates a lot of sensor data.

#### **Applications of Big Data**

We cannot talk about data without talking about the people, people who are getting benefited by Big Data applications. Almost all the industries today are leveraging Big Data applications in one or the other way.

![Big-Data-Applications](C:\Users\GandhaMa\Pictures\Saved Pictures\BigData\Big-Data-Applications.png)

- **Smarter Healthcare**: Making use of the petabytes of patient’s data, the organization can extract meaningful information and then build applications that can predict the patient’s deteriorating condition in advance.


- **Telecom**: Telecom sectors collects information, analyzes it and provide solutions to different problems. By using Big Data applications, telecom companies have been able to significantly reduce data packet loss, which occurs when networks are overloaded, and thus, providing a seamless connection to their customers.


- **Retail**: Retail has some of the tightest margins, and is one of the greatest beneficiaries of big data. The beauty of using big data in retail is to understand consumer behavior. Amazon’s recommendation engine provides suggestion based on the browsing history of the consumer.


- **Traffic control**: Traffic congestion is a major challenge for many cities globally. Effective use of data and sensors will be key to managing traffic better as cities become increasingly densely populated.


- **Manufacturing**: Analyzing big data in the manufacturing industry can reduce component defects, improve product quality, increase efficiency, and save time and money.


- **Search Quality**: Every time we are extracting information from google, we are simultaneously generating data for it. Google stores this data and uses it to improve its search quality.

Someone has rightly said: ***“Not everything in the garden is Rosy"*** Till now in this Big Data tutorial, I have just shown you the rosy picture of Big Data. But if it was so easy to leverage Big data, don’t you think all the organizations would invest in it? Let me tell you upfront, that is not the case. There are several challenges which come along when you are working with Big Data.

#### **Challenges with Big Data**

Let me tell you few challenges which come along with Big Data:

1. **Data Quality** – The problem here is the 4th V i.e. Veracity. The data here is very messy, inconsistent and incomplete. Dirty data cost $600 billion to the companies every year in the United States.
2. **Discovery** – Finding insights on Big Data is like finding a needle in a haystack. Analyzing petabytes of data using extremely powerful algorithms to find patterns and insights are very difficult.
3. **Storage** – The more data an organization has, the more complex the problems of managing it can become. The question that arises here is “Where to store it?”. We need a storage system which can easily scale up or down on-demand.
4. **Analytics** – In the case of Big Data, most of the time we are unaware of the kind of data we are dealing with, so analyzing that data is even more difficult.
5. **Security** – Since the data is huge in size, keeping it secure is another challenge. It includes user authentication, restricting access based on a user, recording data access histories, proper use of data encryption etc.
6. **Lack of Talent – **There are a lot of Big Data projects in major organizations, but a sophisticated team of developers, data scientists and analysts who also have sufficient amount of domain knowledge is still a challenge.
