## 1. Hadoop Tutorial – Objective

The Hadoop tutorial is a comprehensive guide on Big Data Hadoop that covers what is Hadoop, what is the need of Hadoop, why Hadoop is most popular, How Hadoop works?

**Apache Hadoop** is an **open source**, **Scalable**, and **Fault tolerant** framework written in **Java**. It efficiently processes large volumes of data on a cluster of commodity hardware. Hadoop is not only a storage system but is a platform for large data storage as well as processing. This Big Data Hadoop tutorial provides a thorough Hadoop introduction.

We will also learn about Hadoop architecture, Hadoop daemons, different flavors of Hadoop. At last, we will cover the introduction of Hadoop components like **HDFS**, **MapReduce**, **Yarn**, etc.

Introduction to Hadoop Tutorial

## 2. What is Hadoop?

**Hadoop** is an open-source tool from the** ASF** – Apache Software Foundation. Open source project means it is freely available and we can even change its source code as per the requirements. If certain functionality does not fulfill your need then you can change it according to your need. Most of Hadoop code is written by *Yahoo, IBM, Facebook, Cloudera.*

It provides an efficient framework for running jobs on multiple nodes of clusters. **Cluster** means a group of systems connected via LAN. Apache Hadoop provides parallel processing of data as it works on multiple machines simultaneously.

**Big Data Hadoop Tutorial Video**

By getting inspiration from **Google**, which has written a paper about the technologies. It is using technologies like **Map-Reduce** programming model as well as its file system (**GFS**). As Hadoop was originally written for the Nutch search engine project. When Doug Cutting and his team were working on it, very soon Hadoop became a top-level project due to its huge popularity.

**Apache Hadoop** is an open source framework written in **Java**. The basic Hadoop programming language is Java, but this does not mean you can code only in Java. You can code in **C, C++, Perl, Python, ruby** etc. You can code the Hadoop framework in any language but it will be more good to code in java as you will have lower level control of the code.

Big Data and Hadoop efficiently processes large volumes of data on a cluster of commodity hardware. Hadoop is for processing huge volume of data. Commodity hardware is the low-end hardware, they are cheap devices which are very economical. Hence, Hadoop is very economic.

Hadoop can be [setup on a single machine (pseudo-distributed mode, ](http://data-flair.training/blogs/install-cloudera-hadoop-cdh5-ubuntu/)but it shows its real power with a cluster of machines. We can scale it to thousand nodes on the fly ie, without any downtime. Therefore, we need not make any system down to add more systems in the cluster. Follow this guide to [learn Hadoop installation on a multi-node cluster](http://data-flair.training/blogs/install-hadoop-2-x-ubuntu-hadoop-multi-node-cluster/).

Hadoop consists of three key parts –

- [**Hadoop Distributed File System**](http://data-flair.training/blogs/comprehensive-hdfs-guide-introduction-architecture-data-read-write-tutorial/) **(HDFS) – **It is the storage layer of Hadoop.
- **Map-Reduce – **It is the data processing layer of Hadoop.
- **YARN – **It is the resource management layer of Hadoop.

In this Hadoop tutorial we will all these three in detail, but first lets discuss the significance of Hadoop.

## 3. Why Hadoop?

Let us now understand why Big Data Hadoop is very popular, why Hadoop capture more than 90% of [**big data** ](http://data-flair.training/blogs/big-picture-of-big-data-top-10-big-data-trends-2017/)market.

[![Apache Hadoop Quiz](https://d2h0cx97tjks2p.cloudfront.net/blogs/wp-content/uploads/hadoop-quiz-tab.png)](https://data-flair.training/blogs/category/quiz/hadoop-quiz/)

Apache Hadoop is not only a storage system but is a platform for data storage as well as processing. It is **scalable** (as we can add more nodes on the fly), **Fault tolerant**(Even if nodes go down, data processed by another node).

Following characteristics of Hadoop make it a unique platform:

- Flexibility to store and mine any type of data whether it is structured, semi-structured or unstructured. It is not bounded by a single schema.
- Excels at processing data of complex nature. Its scale-out architecture divides workloads across many nodes. Another added advantage is that its flexible file-system eliminates ETL bottlenecks.
- Scales economically, as discussed it can deploy on commodity hardware. Apart from this its open-source nature guards against vendor lock.

## 4. What is Hadoop Architecture?

After understanding what is Apache Hadoop, let us now understand the Big Data Hadoop Architecture in detail.

![Hadoop Architecture](https://d2h0cx97tjks2p.cloudfront.net/blogs/wp-content/uploads/Hadoop-Architecture.png)

Hadoop Architecture

[Learn Hadoop from Industry Experts](https://data-flair.training/big-data-hadoop/)

Hadoop works in **master-slave** fashion. There is a master node and there are n numbers of slave nodes where n can be 1000s. Master manages, maintains and monitors the slaves while slaves are the actual worker nodes. In Hadoop architecture the Master should deploy on good configuration hardware, not just commodity hardware. As it is the centerpiece of [**Hadoop cluster**.](http://data-flair.training/blogs/installation-hadoop-3-x-ubuntu-pseudo-distributed-mode/)

Master stores the metadata (data about data) while slaves are the nodes which store the data. Distributedly data stores in the cluster. The client connects with master node to perform any task.

## 5. Hadoop Components

There are three most important Apache Hadoop Components. Here, you will learn what is HDFS, what is Hadoop MapReduce and what is Yarn Hadoop. Let us discuss them one by one-

### 5.1. What is HDFS?

[**Hadoop HDFS or Hadoop Distributed Flie System**](http://data-flair.training/blogs/comprehensive-hdfs-guide-introduction-architecture-data-read-write-tutorial/) is a distributed file system which provides storage in Hadoop in a distributed fashion.

In Hadoop Architecture on the master node, a daemon called **\*namenode*** run for HDFS. On all the slaves a daemon called **\*datanode*** run for HDFS. Hence slaves are also called as datanode. Namenode stores meta-data and manages the datanodes. On the other hand, Datanodes stores the data and do the actual task.

![Hadoop HDFS Architecture](https://d2h0cx97tjks2p.cloudfront.net/blogs/wp-content/uploads/hadoop-hdfs-architecture-1.jpg)

Hadoop HDFS Architecture

HDFS is a highly **fault tolerant**, **distributed**, **reliable** and **scalable** file system for data storage. First Follow this guide to[ learn more about features of HDFS](http://data-flair.training/blogs/features-hadoop-hdfs-overview-beginners/) and then proceed further with the Hadoop tutorial.

HDFS is developed to handle huge volumes of data. The file size expected is in the range of GBs to TBs. A file is split up into blocks (default 128 MB) and stored distributedly across multiple machines. These blocks replicate as per the replication factor. After replication, it stored at different nodes. This handles the **failure of a node** in the cluster. So if there is a file of 640 MB, it breaks down into 5 blocks of 128 MB each (if we use the default value).

### 5.2. What is MapReduce?

The** Hadoop MapReduce** is a programming model. As it is designed for large volumes of data in parallel by dividing the work into a set of independent tasks. MapReduce is the heart of Hadoop, it moves computation close to the data. As a movement of a huge volume of data will be very costly. It allows massive scalability across hundreds or thousands of servers in a [**Hadoop cluster.**](http://data-flair.training/blogs/install-deploy-cloudera-hadoop-cdh5-apache-2-x-centos/)

Hence, Hadoop MapReduce is a framework for distributed processing of huge volumes of data set over a cluster of nodes. As data stores in a distributed manner in HDFS. It provides the way to **Map**–**Reduce** to perform parallel processing.

### 5.3. What is YARN Hadoop?

[**YARN – Yet Another Resource Negotiator**](http://data-flair.training/blogs/hadoop-yarn-tutorial/) is the resource management layer of Hadoop. In the multi-node cluster, as it becomes very complex to manage/allocate/release the resources (CPU, memory, disk). **Hadoop Yarn** manages the resources quite efficiently. It allocates the same on request from any application.

On the master node, the **ResourceManager** daemon runs for the YARN then for all the slave nodes **NodeManager** daemon runs.

## 6. Hadoop Daemons

Daemons are the processes that run in the background. There are mainly 4 daemons which run for Hadoop.

![Hadoop Daemons](https://d2h0cx97tjks2p.cloudfront.net/blogs/wp-content/uploads/HADOOP-DAEMONS-ARCHITECTURE-vo.1-01-min.png)

Hadoop Daemons

- **Namenode** – It runs on master node for HDFS.
- **Datanode** – It runs on slave nodes for HDFS.
- **ResourceManager** – It runs on master node for Yarn.
- **NodeManager** – It runs on slave node for Yarn.

These 4 demons run for Hadoop to be functional. Apart from this, there can be secondary NameNode, standby NameNode, Job HistoryServer, etc.

## 7. How do Hadoop works?

Till now we have studied Hadoop Introduction and Hadoop architecture in detail. Now next Let us summarize Apache [Hadoop working](http://data-flair.training/blogs/how-hadoop-works-internal-working-and-its-components/) step by step:

**i)** Input data breaks into blocks of size 128 Mb (by default) and then moves to different nodes.

**ii)** Once all the blocks of the file stored on datanodes then a user can process the data.

**iii)** Then, master schedules the program (submitted by the user) on individual nodes.

**iv)** Once all the nodes process the data then the output is[ written back to HDFS](http://data-flair.training/blogs/hdfs-data-write-operation/).

## 8. Hadoop Flavors

Below are the various flavors of Hadoop.

- **Apache** – Vanilla flavor, as the actual code is residing in Apache repositories.
- **Hortonworks** – Popular distribution in the industry.
- **Cloudera** – It is the most popular in the industry.
- **MapR** – It has rewritten HDFS and its HDFS is faster as compared to others.
- **IBM** – Proprietary distribution is known as Big Insights.

All the databases have provided native connectivity with Hadoop for fast data transfer. Because, to transfer data from Oracle to Hadoop, you need a connector.

All flavors are almost same and if you know one, you can easily work on other flavors as well.

## 9. Hadoop Ecosystem Components

In this section of Hadoop tutorial, we will cover Hadoop ecosystem components. Let us see what all the components form the **Hadoop Eco-System**:

![Ecosystem components of Apache Hadoop](https://d2h0cx97tjks2p.cloudfront.net/blogs/wp-content/uploads/apache-hadoop-ecosystem-components-2.jpg)

Hadoop Ecosystem Components
